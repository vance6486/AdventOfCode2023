expand the universe

assign all galaxies numbers

search from each galaxy to find the shortest path to all the other galaxies
	Do a breadth first search and, when you encounter a galaxy for the first time, record how many steps you took
	This becomes your collection of connections

Next, go through each galaxy and, if the current galaxy is also the shortest path for the other galaxy, make them a pair and discard the other matches

once you have matched up all the galaxies, find the length of all the shortest paths.
